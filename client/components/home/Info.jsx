      <h2>Codesmith Scholarships</h2>
      <p>
        For each is a scholarship program developed by Codesmith alumni which aims to provide financial aid for aspiring software engineers who would like to attend the immersive program.
        Upon graduation, many Codesmith alumni have the opportunity to secure great jobs which enables them to improve the quality of their lives and also to give back to their community.
        A group of passionate Codesmith residents decided to create the program forEach with the intent to facilitate payment of tuition for the future students who need the most.
        We are firm believers that compassion and generosity are qualities that makes our community great and are delighted to bring this idea to fruition with forEach.
        If you would like to become a sponsor and have the opportunity to truly make a difference in our growing community, sign up and donate today.
